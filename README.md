Project to predict schizophrenia and Depression from activity data

It has been well-established that behavioral disorders
such as depression and schizophrenia are hard to diagnose.
Classifying the type of the disorder is a challenging task because
of the diversity of the symptoms. Furthermore, estimation of the
severity level of such disorders is another challenging factor in
the diagnosis process. Current clinical diagnostic procedures tend
to be mostly dependent on the self-reporting of patients or the
limited observational evaluations of clinicians. Hence, there is a
need for objective analytical methods that leverage the current
informatics advancements in studying behavior disorders.

77 particpants [23 diagnosed depression; 22 diagnosed schizophrenic 
and 32 Control patients] wore devices ro record activity levels. Per 
minute readings over an 2 week period [approx] was taken.

It is hoped that the results of this project will assist in the 
development of automated systems supporting the existing subjective
diagnostic practice within mental health.
